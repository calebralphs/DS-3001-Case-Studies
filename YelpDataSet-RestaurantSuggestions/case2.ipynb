We now have access to all of the reviews for all of the business’ that the user has reviewed. Then, in order to find other businesses that the program thinks the user would like, we looked at all the reviews for other businesses that other users who also gave good reviews to the same businesses that our user gave good reviews to. We run an algorithm on that list of reviews, and extract the top reviews based on star rating and number of reviews. We think that this would more accurately show the user what businesses they would like, rather than just picking businesses based on popularity from random reviewers that may have no similar tastes as the user. We think looking at reviews from users with similar tastes would be much more meaningful and relevant for a user seeking out new business’ to try."

      "Great Mexican food!  I had the shredded beef burro enchilada style and my husband had the cheese and fajita chicken quesadilla.  Both very tasty!  Very big cold beers too for a very reasonable price.  Nice atmosphere in the bar and close to home.\n",
      "Durant's is a classy, old-style, American steakhouse.  We have been going there for 10+ years and have only been disappointed once.  We were not served the amazing bread with garlic butter and leeks - just rolls.  The waiter dropped a shrimp from my shrimp cocktail on the table and picked it up and stuck it back with his bare hands.  Then when we received our dinner we noted a rosemary sprig stuck into the mashed potatoes.  That never happened before.  Not a big deal, but we have never been big on foofy presentation and Durant's has never been like that.  Just really excellent service, cocktails and amazingly good food!  We stayed away for a while as it is a pretty good hike from home and didn't want to be disappointed again - after all, it's a really expensive place but worth it when you have NEVER, I mean never ever, been disappointed before. \n",
      "\n",
      "To make a long story short, we had heard so many people had complained, they brought the bread back.  We decided to try it again a few months ago and again last night.  We have only ordered drinks and appetizers, so we don't know if they still stick rosemary sprigs in the mashed potatoes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Last night we sat at the bar and the service was amazing!  We ordered Stoli martinis and there was absolutely no scrimping on the vodka.  I couldn't finish mine as it was a too much for me, but we certainly got a big bang for our buck!  We both got the Ceasar salad and I had the shrimp cocktail - huge tender shrimp in cocktail sauce with a dollop of sinus blasting horseradish just like I like it.  My husband had the Durant's Debris - perfectly cooked cubes of steak served with a very flavorful dipping sauce.\n",
      "\n",
      "Durant's is again our favorite special-occasion restaurant!\n",
      "My husband and I decided to do a little staycation at the Wigwam - just 2 nights.  We had never stayed there before, but had attended a seminar and an office function in the past and we thought it was a pretty cool place.  Lots of history, which we really love!  When we arrived on Monday we asked for a room over by the adult pool, and the person checking us in said, \"Oh, the Oasis Pool?\" and we said yes.  I had read on their website that it was an adult pool and she confirmed that with her statement.  So we were off to our room and I had lovely visions of laying by the pool with nice music playing and a cabana bar nearby where waitpeople would come by and bring us fruity rum drinks.  So we got our suits on and ventured out to the pool.  There were only 3 other people there, and two of them were teenagers.  No big deal.  They were being quiet.  So we looked around for the cabana bar, and there was one, but it was closed (and there was no music).  I was disappointed, but thought maybe it would open a little later (it was 3:00pm).  Well it didn't open and it was pretty obvious that it would not open anytime in our lifetime.  So my husband found a phone over at the bar with a sign that said you could order over the phone and they would bring the drinks/food to us.  We ordered a Bud Light and a fruity rum drink.  It took about 20 minutes to arrive.  The bill was $24.00.  $24.00!!!!!!  The beer was $5, fruity rum drink was $8, a room service fee of $7 and a delivery fee of $4!  Was it our fault the Cabana bar wasn't open?!?  I asked the server (who could barely speak English) when the Cabana bar would be open.  She said in broken English, \"Only open on special occasions\".  What?!?  So off she went and then here come the little kiddos all excited and immediately doing cannonballs off the side of the pool!  Woo hoo!!!  OK, now I'm upset.  So I call the resort on my cell and ask if they have an adult pool.  I'm told the main pool is separated by a bridge and one side has the water slide, etc, blah, blah.  Then I say, I heard you have an Oasis Pool that is for adults.  And I'm told, well, most of the kids are at the other pool, so you would only occasionally see children at the Oasis Pool (as I'm being splashed by the latest cannonball).  He says, children are allowed at all the pools, however.  I thanked him.  Ok, so they don't have a specific \"adult\" pool.  Just another disappointment.  Don't get me wrong, I love kids.  I just don't want to put up with screaming and cannonballs while I'm attempting to enjoy my $12 Mai tai.\n",
      "Our room was nice, but it seemed a little odd that they would have this high tech touch screen computer on the desk touting their resort services along with an old fashioned TV in the old fashioned entertainment center.  And by the way, the picture links on the touch screen didn't work.  Our bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was very large with lots of towels and toiletries.  Very nice Mexican style glassware and the usual coffee maker.\n",
      "We decided to try the other pool (the one with the slide), because it did have a bar and music.  We thought if we stayed on the non-slide side it wouldn't be too bad.  And we were right.  Not too many kids.  We enjoyed our time there and had lunch by the pool which was served to us in our lounge chairs.  I had another Mai tai which was minus the delivery fees.  My husband brought his own Bud Lights which we secretly stashed on ice in our beach bag.  \n",
      "The resort was clean and well maintained.  We didn't have breakfast or dinner there, but lunch by the pool was very good.  Probably won't go back due to the lack of the adult pool, but overall it is a nice resort.\n",
      "We attended our first wine tasting on 5/7.  Very friendly atmosphere and we learned quite a bit about Chilean wines.  Tapas were served as well.  We totally enjoyed our experience!\n"
